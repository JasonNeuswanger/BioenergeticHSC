1,0,0,1,0,,,,,,,Column A is an arbitrary index number (or text label) of the point to be processed
2,20,18,1,0.5,,,,,,,Column B is the depth at that point (cm)
3,35,36,1,1,,,,,,,Column C is the velocity at that point (cm/s)
4,45,49,1,1.5,,,,,,,"Column D is arbitrary numeric or text label for each transect. It can represent the longitudinal position of the transect, but it doesn't have to, because that information isn't used here."
5,43,46,1,2,,,,,,,Column E is the position (in meters) of a the point this row represents along its transect. First and last points will be interpreted as the edges of the river and can have 0 depth/velocity.
6,40,42,1,2.5,,,,,,,Column F is bed roughness height (cm) for a log velocity profile
7,10,7,1,3,,,,,,,Column G is fork length (cm); is ignored unless mass is also specified
8,0,0,1,3.5,,,,,,,Column H is mass (g); is ignored unless fork length is also specified
9,0,0,2,0,,,,,,,Column I is for temperature in degrees C
10,25,24,2,0.75,,,,,,,Column J is turbidity in NTU
11,50,56,2,1.5,,,,,,,Column K is the address for the drift density CSV file
12,60,70,2,2.25,,,,,,,"Columns F-K are optional, but don't delete the columns or their headers; just leave the cells blank if you don't want to specify them"
13,65,78,2,3,,,,,,,"If you leave an optional column blank, it will default to the values specified on the Model Settings tab"

25,0,0,4,0,,,,,,,"Weird transect 4 is meant a a test of the transect modeling mechanism, set up such that the interpolated "
26,25,25,4,0.5,,,,,,,depths and velocities in the middle of the transect (PositionOnTransect=20) should be 
27,25,25,4,20,,,,,,,uniform at 25 each. This allows comparison of results from that mechanism with results from 
28,25,25,4,40,,,,,,,a conventional model run at depth=25 and velocity=25. Batch method 1 point labeled 21 has
30,0,0,4,40.5,,,,,,,these depths and velocities for comparison.
