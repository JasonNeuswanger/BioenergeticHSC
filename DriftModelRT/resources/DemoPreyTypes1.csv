1 mm midge,0.5,1.5,6,0.0018,2.617,5424,,Values beyond column G are ignored and can be used for notes.
1 mm class,0.5,1.5,2,,,,,"Not every prey type has to represent a size class. You can use multiple rows for taxa of the same size with different regression parameters, for example."
2 mm midge,1.51,2.5,5,0.0018,2.617,5424,,"The 'a' and 'b' values in columns E and F are for the body length-dry mass regression W = a L^b, with L in mm and W in mg"
2 mm class,1.51,2.5,1,,,,,"When they are left blank, default parameters for 'All Insects' from Benke et al 1999 are used."
3 mm class,2.51,3.5,4.5,,,,,"Energy density is given in calories per gram dry weight. When it is left blank, a default of 5200 is used (Rosenfeld and Taylor 2009)."
4 mm class,3.51,4.5,2.5,,,,,"In this example, we have separate prey types for Chironomid larvae in the two smallest size classes versus other taxa."
5 mm class,4.51,5.5,1.8,,,,,Drift density is the number of drifting prey items in that category per cubic meter of water
6 mm class,5.51,6.5,0.6,,,,,The 'label' can be whatever you want
7 mm class,6.51,7.5,0.2,,,,,
8 mm class,7.51,8.5,0.05,,,,,
