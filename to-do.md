# To-do list

* Make saved/loaded settings include drift density file and batch files.
* Allow spatial grid resolution to be in cm or bodylengths.
* Make file extension more obvious when saving .hsc files.
* Remove option for piecewise capture success function
* Modify Wisconsin model parameters for larger fish
* Fix the left-side plot label cropping when there are lots of digits on axis labels.

# Upgrades to-do list

* Because the risk metric is meant to be minimized, higher values on the graph are worse results. That's 
  kind of counter-intuitive. Maybe multiply by -1 and label accordingly, or graph upside down?
* Make batch method 3 work with the daily-scale modeling.
* Add diagnostic plots to explore foraging strategy choices being made within each day.

# Bug list

* When going to change some files (drift density?) and canceling dialog instead of selecting a file, the program crashes.
