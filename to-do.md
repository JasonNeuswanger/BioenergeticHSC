# To-do list

* Make saved/loaded settings include drift density file and batch files.
* Allow spatial grid resolution to be in cm or bodylengths.
* Make file extension more obvious when saving .hsc files.

# Bug list

* When going to change some files (drift density?) and canceling dialog instead of selecting a file, the program crashes.
